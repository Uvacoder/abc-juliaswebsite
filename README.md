#### Inspiration

The idea was to keep it simple and direct to the content. I wanted to build the site from sratch (at least as much to my ability). Eventually after learning different tech, I decided to go with Gatsby/Strapi. With this approach, I could setup the backend to be easily accesbile. Gatsby was choosen because of the speed and ability to work with images via gatsby-image.

## Tech:

Gatsby, Cloudinary, Strapi

### NPM plugins:

react-masonry-css, simple-react-lightbox
